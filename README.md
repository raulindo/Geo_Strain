# Geo_Strain

## Objectives

Structural geologists often seek to describe and quantify the amount of strain suffered by rocks. The first numerical approach were carried out by Ramsay (1976) and since then, new techniques were developed. This work is intended to compute the amount of Strain in thin sections. 

The scripts here developed aim to calculate Strain Ellipses on planes (2D). This is done by analysing an image containing quartz grains interpreted, followed by the best-fit of ellipses to each grain. Then, we can measure importante structural parameters, such as:
  - The axis ratio (as well as long and short axis) of each ellipse adjusted;
  - The angle between the long axis of each ellipse and the horizontal;
  - The center coordinates of each grain;

## What is needed to be done

 - Calculate mean Strain Ellipse using Fry Method
 - Develop Rf/Phi Plot
 - Hopefully, we will be able to develop script to calculate the Best-Fit ellipsoid. 
 - In the Future, better ways to import image data (maybe automatic quartz grain recognition?)
